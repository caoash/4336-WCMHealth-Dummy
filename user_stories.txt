Basic UI 

As an engineer, I want access to a basic UI with links to each of the pages (React + Tailwind) 

 

Home Page 

As an engineer, I want access to a home page, with the ability to upload data and run a health report. 

 

Config Page 

As an engineer, I want access to a config page, where I can create new details or modify existing ones. The details allow users to specify requirements. 

Config Build 

As a developer maintaining this tool internally, I want the health report generation to work on dummy data, which is stored within version control. 

 

Parsing Algorithm 

As an engineer, I want the health report to utilize an algorithm to process config thresholds to generate a status, rather than using dummy values for status. 

Scaling Up 

•A As an engineer, I want to be able to upload larger files (up to 50,000-line CSV), displayed in a visually appealing way while having health report generation still occur quickly. 
Additionally, I want to implement pagination so that the UI remains responsive and users can navigate large datasets efficiently. 
Visualization 

• As an engineer, I want to be able to see visualizations of specific columns of the uploaded data.
